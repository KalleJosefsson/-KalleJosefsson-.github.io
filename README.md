CS 180A Computer Vision
Course in Computer Vision and Image Analysis at UC Berkeley. I am taking the course during the fall of 2024 and it consists of 5 computr projects and then one large final project. I will post my results and websites continously while taking the course. For anti-copying reasons the code will be posted after the course is done in December. My website where I post the results can be found by following the link: kallejosefsson.github.io
