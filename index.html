        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I developed an object detection model using the YOLOv4 architecture.
            The system is capable of detecting multiple objects in real-time, achieving high accuracy
            on various datasets. The project explores the use of deep learning to recognize and
            classify objects from live video streams or static images.

            Above is a screenshot from the object detection model, where the system identifies objects
            such as cars, people, and bicycles in real-time.

    <!-- Project Description Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The object detection model is built using the YOLOv4 architecture, which is known for its balance
            between speed and accuracy. By feeding the model images or frames from a video, it applies a convolutional
            neural network (CNN) to detect and classify objects within bounding boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system works by breaking down the image into grid cells and assigning probabilities to each grid.
            If the probability exceeds a threshold, a bounding box is created, identifying the object within that region.
            The result is a real-time detection system with accurate bounding boxes around detected objects.
        </p>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This project demonstrated the powerful capabilities of YOLOv4 in object detection, achieving fast and accurate
            results. The model can be further optimized by training on larger datasets or by fine-tuning hyperparameters to
            improve performance.
