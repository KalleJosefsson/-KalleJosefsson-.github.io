        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I developed three algorithms which tackles the task of image alignment similarly. For handling smaller jpeg images with fewer pixels and smaller displacements
            I just do normal MSE of each pixel in the middle part of the image to ingore the edges and then shift the image one pixel to find the best alignment. For larger images this is not effective so compress the image using convolutions with 3x3 kernels and 
            perform average pooling. This is done twice compressing the image to be 1/81 the size of the original image. Then I find the best alignment using the same algorithm as for the jpegs. After doing that
            I move up a level in the pyramid shift the image based on the findings in the below level and repeat, now the image is just 1/9 the size of the original image and we find a better match. The final shift is then done on the original image to
            get the alignment as close as possible. For some images just basing the alignment on pixels is not possible so I wrote an algorithm which does it based one edges and features instead, this was made by
            filtering the image using the sobel filter and then doing the same procedure using the pyramid alignment algorithm, this worked very well and the results are presented below.

    <!-- Project Description Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The object detection model is built using the YOLOv4 architecture, which is known for its balance
            between speed and accuracy. By feeding the model images or frames from a video, it applies a convolutional
            neural network (CNN) to detect and classify objects within bounding boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system works by breaking down the image into grid cells and assigning probabilities to each grid.
            If the probability exceeds a threshold, a bounding box is created, identifying the object within that region.
            The result is a real-time detection system with accurate bounding boxes around detected objects.

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This project demonstrated the powerful capabilities of YOLOv4 in object detection, achieving fast and accurate
            results. The model can be further optimized by training on larger datasets or by fine-tuning hyperparameters to
            improve performance.
