        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I developed three algorithms that tackle the task of image alignment similarly. 
            For handling smaller JPEG images with fewer pixels and smaller displacements, I used normal Mean Squared Error (MSE) 
            for each pixel in the middle part of the image (to ignore the edges), and then I shifted the image one pixel at a time 
            to find the best alignment. For larger images, this was not effective, so I compressed the image using convolutions 
            with 3x3 kernels and performed average pooling. This was done twice, compressing the image to be 1/81 the size of the original image. 
            After that, I found the best alignment using the same algorithm as for the JPEGs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving up a level in the pyramid, I shifted the image based on the findings at the lower level and repeated, 
            now the image was 1/9 the size of the original image, which resulted in a better match. The final shift was 
            then done on the original image to get the best possible alignment. For some images, pixel-based alignment was 
            not sufficient, so I developed an algorithm based on edges and features instead, using a Sobel filter followed 
            by the same pyramid alignment procedure. This worked well, and the results are presented below.
