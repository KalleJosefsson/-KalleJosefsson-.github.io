    <p>
      For project 3 we are supposed to do morphing between faces, change facial features and expressions. This is actually done quite easily by first just manually annotating corresponding points on faces.
      Then  triangulation of these points which is done using the Delaunay algorithm so that we get corresponing triangulation betweeen two different faces. After that we can do all sorts of cool stuff by just
      warping and cross disolving. By using affine transformations we warp faceshapes into other peoples shapes and by crossdissolving which is essentially linear interpolation of the colors we can create
      realistic blends of faces using more than jsut the shapes. Below I will go through the process step by step following the project tasks

        <p>
            For this task I used the program recommended for annotating correspodning points for two images, one of me and one of famous actor Leonardo DiCaprio. I chose 66 corresponding points on each face
            and then added 4 more corner points leading to a total of 70 points in each image. Below I present the triangulation of the corresponding points. Note that I tried to capture as many facial features
            with as few points as possible in order to get as good of a result possible with less computation time.

        <h3> Part 2: Computing the halfway face </h3>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>
            Now that I have the corresponding triangulations for each face the fun begins. The first thing I do is calculate the halfway face which is done by doing the follow. First we calculate the halfway keypoints
            by taking the average of my key points and Leo's keypoints. Then we again triangulate using our new halfway keypoints so that we get a new set of triangles. Then we warp my triangles into the corresponding 
            trinagles of the midway face as well as Leo's triangles. This is done by affine transformation which maps one trinagle into another, we calculate the transformation matrix , T, for transforming a source triangle, X, into a target triangle
            , y, by solving the linear system using numpy's function linalgsolve(x,y). This is done for each triangle in both the image of me and Leo, now we have warped our faces into the average between our faces. Now we want to
            change the color so that we get a good blend between not only the shapes, this is done by cross dissolving, take the average of the pixel values and adding them together. After normalization I got the following
            results.
