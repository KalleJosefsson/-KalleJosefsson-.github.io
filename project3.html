      For project 3 we are supposed to do morphing between faces, change facial features and expressions. This is actually done quite easily by first just manually annotating corresponding points on faces.
      Then  triangulation of these points which is done using the Delaunay algorithm so that we get corresponing triangulation betweeen two different faces. After that we can do all sorts of cool stuff by just
      warping and cross disolving. By using affine transformations we warp faceshapes into other peoples shapes and by crossdissolving which is essentially linear interpolation of the colors we can create
      realistic blends of faces using more than jsut the shapes. Below I will go through the process step by step following the project tasks

            For this task I used the program recommended for annotating correspodning points for two images, one of me and one of famous actor Leonardo DiCaprio. I chose 66 corresponding points on each face
            and then added 4 more corner points at each of the image in order to get better results. Below I present the triangulation of the corresponding points. Note that I tried to capture as many facial features
            with as few points as possible in order to get as good of a result possible with less computation time.
